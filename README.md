## 🧠 Who am I?

- 🧪 A 3rd year B.Tech CSE alchemist, synthesizing bugs into features  
- 🎮 Once lost an online match because I was fixing a segfault mid-fight  
- 🤕 Currently recovering from a boss fight with real-life autoimmune issues — but still respawning daily  
- 🧘‍♂️ Working on self-upgrades, both personal and professional  
- 🪄 I write Python that feels like sorcery and C++ that needs therapy
